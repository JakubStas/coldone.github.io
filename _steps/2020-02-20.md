##### Notes

One of the berry-flavoured bottles was refrigerated on the 5th day of the second fermentation. Expectations
were high for fizziness, but it didn't deliver. The liquid was sifted to remove any berry lumps or baby scoby.
The taste was pleasant and fruity, but not enough acidic component to it and no fizziness at all. The remaining
bottles will be kept fermenting for at least a couple more days.
