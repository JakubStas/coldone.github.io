## Market check

Based on what is locally available the average adjusted price for 0.5L
in retail comes to € 4. Given our production to date, 10 batches of 3
liters of kombucha each, to purchase the same amount given the estimate
would come to € 240 (if bought in small amounts throughout the months).

By deciding to brew our own kombucha and owning the production process,
we broke even at the 5th batch and are currently saving € 125 feeding
our habit.

With the continuous production, we should see even better returns on this
investment and shall revisit this in a few months!
