##### Tasting notes

The last blueberry flavoured bottle has been fermenting for about 8 days now
and it managed to develop a more acidic base compared to the previous two
bottles. It was less sweet than the previous ones and even developed a bit
of carbonation - even though it was rather subtle. The bottle even made a
little sound when opened for the first time. Yay!
