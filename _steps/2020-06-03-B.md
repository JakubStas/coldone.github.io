##### Tea

1. Starter tea from Assam tea batch
2. 3 liters of Assam tea - loose leaves
    * (10 grams per jug, brewed for 15 minutes)

##### Sugar

140 grams (70 grams per jug)

##### Notes

Bottles from batch 11 are still too vinegary for our taste, so we need to
reduce the 1F brewing time. We decided to discard extra scoby discs, clean
the brewing vessel and filter the remaining kombucha. Let's try with 5 day
1F and go by taste.
