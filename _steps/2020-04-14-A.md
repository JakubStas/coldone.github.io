Bottling and flavoring of brew no. 6.

##### Flavoring

Blueberry flavor:
1. 1 pack of frozen blackberries 340g (Dunnes)
2. 1 cup of water

Yields 6x 0,5 L bottles of kombucha.

##### 2F duration

? days

##### Notes

The inconsistency between bottles in how intense the burping is (the carbon
production) still remains. We might need to explore some options of more
precise flavoring distribution than eyeballing it.
