Start of batch no. 3.

##### Tea

1. Starter tea from [Lean Matcha Green](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/shop/organic-teas/lean-matcha-green/) batch
2. 3 liters of [Lean Matcha Green](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/shop/organic-teas/lean-matcha-green/) - tea bags
    * (three tea bags per jug, brewed for 15 minutes)

##### Sugar

250 grams

##### Notes

Brewing jar filled up to its capacity. A new layer of scoby that developed
in brew no. 2 started to float on its own and keep its shape. It looks much
nicer, clearer and more uniform than the other scoby disks in the brewing 
vessel.
