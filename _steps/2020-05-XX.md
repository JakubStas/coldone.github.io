All the batches except #10 used [Lean Matcha Green](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/shop/organic-teas/lean-matcha-green/) as a base.
The last one used Assam as a base tea.

`*` Due to the lack of experience the end kombucha was too sweet and not very fizzy. The flavour however was very promising and deserves a proper treatment.
