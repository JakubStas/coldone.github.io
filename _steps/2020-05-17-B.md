Start of batch no. 10.

##### Tea

1. Starter tea from [Lean Matcha Green](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/shop/organic-teas/lean-matcha-green/) batch
2. 3 liters of Assam tea - loose leaves
    * (13 grams per jug, brewed for 10 minutes)

##### Sugar

100 grams (50 grams per jug)

##### Notes

For our tenth batch we decided to change the base tea and go for a classic black tea - Assam.
As of now, we don't know how strong the brew is in the context of brewing kombucha, so
this is going to be a highly experimental batch. It will be interesting to observe the 
impact of type of tea on the overall sweetness to acidity ratio given the established process.
