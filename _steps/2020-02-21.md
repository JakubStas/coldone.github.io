##### Tasting notes

It has been 6 days since the 2nd batch was set to brew. Tasting of this
batch reveals more acidity and first signs of fizziness! The flavour of
the tea remains well defined and the sweetness becomes acceptable. The 
bottling is not too far from here.

##### Notes

As a bonus, a distinct new layer of scoby started to form on the top of
the brewing vessel. I wonder what is going to happen when bottling comes
and new batch of tea is poured in. Will the layer be thick enough to
withstand the pouring of the tea?
