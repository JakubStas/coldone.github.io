Bottling and flavoring of brew no. 5.

##### Flavoring

Mango flavor:
1. 1 pack of frozen blackberries 340g (Dunnes)
2. 1 cup of water

Yields 6x 0,5 L bottles of kombucha.

##### 2F duration

? days

##### Notes

As noted for the 2F of batch #4 there is some inconsistency between bottles
in how fizzy the kombucha gets. We might need to explore some options of more
precise flavoring distribution than eyeballing it.
