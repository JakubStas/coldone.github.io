Bottling and flavoring of brew no. 7.

##### Flavoring

Sour cherry flavor:
1. 1/2 pack of frozen sour cherries 170g (Dunnes)
2. 1 cup of water

Yields 6x 0,5 L bottles of kombucha.

##### 2F duration

10 days

##### Notes

Keeping an extra close look on the portioning of the flavoring did away with
the fizziness inconsistencies (for the most part). We are trying the reduced
amount of fruit in this batch used as flavoring. It proved sufficient to use
just the half of the package to both reduce the burp produced and achieve a
very nice ratio of fruity and acidic flavour.
