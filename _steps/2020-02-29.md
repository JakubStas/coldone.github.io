##### 2F duration

6 days

##### Tasting notes

After leaving the 2F do its thing for 6 days, some really serious fizziness
developed. The kombucha is still a bit too sweet so for the batch no. 4 we
need to reduce the amount of sugar in both 1F and 2F. The flavour of the tea
remains well defined and lightly acidic, but the sweetness is still on the
higher end of what would be desired.
