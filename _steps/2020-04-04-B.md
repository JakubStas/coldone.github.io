Start of batch no. 6.

##### Tea

1. Starter tea from [Lean Matcha Green](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/shop/organic-teas/lean-matcha-green/) batch
2. 3 liters of [Lean Matcha Green](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/shop/organic-teas/lean-matcha-green/) - tea bags
    * (three tea bags per jug, brewed for 15 minutes)

##### Sugar

150 grams (75 grams per jug)

##### Notes

We removed the oldest scoby disc, so we are currently brewing only using
the scoby, that had developed over the previous brewing cycles described
on this website. We might consider reducing the amount of sugar still for
the next batch as the slight uptake in acidity was rather delicious and 
refreshing.
