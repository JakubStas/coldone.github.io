##### Flavoring

Sour cherry flavor:
1. 1/2 pack of frozen sour cherries 170g (Dunnes)
2. 1 cup of water

Yields 6x 0,5 L bottles of kombucha.

##### 2F duration

7 days

##### Notes

Turns out with the black tea, we can't have the 1F take as long as 10 days
(which was the standard for green tea batches) because the final brew
gets overly vinegary. We are going to shorten 1F for the following batch
to 7 days and adjust from there.
