Start of batch no. 8.

##### Tea

1. Starter tea from [Lean Matcha Green](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/shop/organic-teas/lean-matcha-green/) batch
2. 3 liters of [Lean Matcha Green](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/shop/organic-teas/lean-matcha-green/) - tea bags
    * (three tea bags per jug, brewed for 15 minutes)

##### Sugar

100 grams (50 grams per jug)

##### Notes

Based on the previous results I think we can keep testing the 100 grams of
sugar for 1F. The fizziness is pretty much spot on what we want so the next
batch will most likely stick to this amount. This was also the first time
we stream our setup procedure online. Good luck with your kombucha, Adam &
Nika!
