##### Tea

1. Starter tea from Assam tea batch
2. 3 liters of [Lean Matcha Green](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/shop/organic-teas/lean-matcha-green/) - tag bags
    * (3 bags per jug, brewed for 15 minutes)

##### Sugar

100 grams (50 grams per jug)

##### 1F duration

10 days

##### Notes

With the return to green tea base only, we are going to stretch the 1F 
back to 10 days. The top layer of scoby looked a bit run down, so we 
removed it keeping one full thick disc in the brewing vessel.
