##### Tea

1. Starter tea from Assam tea batch
2. 3 liters of Assam tea - loose leaves
    * (10 grams per jug, brewed for 15 minutes)

##### Sugar

140 grams (70 grams per jug)

##### 1F duration

7 days

##### Notes

For this batch we are going to commit to shorter 1F to cut back the more
pronounced vinegar flavour. Judging by the contents of the brewing vessel,
we will have to do some cleaning and discard some scobi disks as it is
getting murky and crowded in there.
